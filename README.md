# Fundamentals of Data Analysis Tasks 2020

### Summary of Assignment

This repository contains my Fundamentals of data Alaysis Assignmnet 2020. It looks at 4 individual tasks.

#### Task 1 
Write a Python function called counts that takes a list as input and returns a dictionary of unique items in the list as keys and the number of times each item appears as values.

#### Task 2

Write a Python function called dicerolls that simulates rolling dice.

#### Task 3
Write some python code that simulates flipping a coin 100 times. Then run this code 1,000 times, keeping track
of the number of heads in each of the 1,000 simulations. Select an appropriate plot to depict the resulting list of 1,000 numbers, showing that it roughly follows a bell-shaped curve.

#### Task 4


I commenced work on this assignment around the 5th of October 2020 and completed work for the deadline on 18th December 2020

### Running the Jupyter Notebook
The Jupyter Notebook App can be launched by clicking on the Jupyter Notebook icon installed by Anaconda in the start menu (Windows) or by typing in a terminal (cmd on Windows):

jupyter notebook This will launch a new browser window (or a new tab) showing the Notebook Dashboard, a sort of control panel that allows (among other things) to select which notebook to open.

When started, the Jupyter Notebook App can access only files within its start-up folder (including any sub-folder). No configuration is necessary if you place your notebooks in your home folder or subfolders. Otherwise, you need to choose a Jupyter Notebook App start-up folder which will contain all the notebooks.

Download the notebook you want to execute and put it in your notebook folder (or a sub-folder of it).

Then follow these steps:

Launch the Jupyter Notebook App (see previous section). In the Notebook Dashboard navigate to find the notebook: clicking on its name will open it in a new browser tab. Click on the menu Help -> User Interface Tour for an overview of the Jupyter Notebook App user interface. You can run the notebook document step-by-step (one cell a time) by pressing shift + enter. You can run the whole notebook in a single step by clicking on the menu Cell -> Run All. To restart the kernel (i.e. the computational engine), click on the menu Kernel -> Restart. This can be useful to start over a computation from scratch (e.g. variables are deleted, open files are closed, etcâ€¦).
